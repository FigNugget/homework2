<p>My name is Alexia and I am currently studying painting and IMG at 
  Northern Arizona University. My hobbies include drawing and playing 
  video games with friends, which inspired me to look for careers relating
  to those topics. I feel that I can succesfully find a career that relates
  to both of those topics, despite there being very few similarites
  between them.</p>
